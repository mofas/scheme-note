# Replace scheme by racket
I start to write exercise with racket instead of scheme from Cheapter 3 because I think racket is mature and well-document to develop with.

# Install Racket 
You can download and install racket here https://download.racket-lang.org/

# Developing with Emacs
I highly recommend developed Lisp like language by using Emacs Racket and paredit mode.
